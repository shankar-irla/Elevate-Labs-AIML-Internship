# Task 5: Decision Trees and Random Forests

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective
To explore tree-based models like Decision Trees and Random Forests for binary classification using the Heart Disease dataset.

## ðŸ§° Tools Used
- Python (Scikit-learn, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Graphviz (optional for advanced tree visualization)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset
**Heart Disease Dataset** with clinical attributes for heart disease diagnosis.  
Target variable: `target` (0 = no disease, 1 = disease)

## âœ… Steps Followed
1. Loaded and explored the dataset.
2. Performed train-test split.
3. Trained and evaluated a Decision Tree Classifier.
4. Visualized the Decision Tree.
5. Trained and compared Random Forest performance.
6. Analyzed feature importances.
7. Applied 5-fold cross-validation.

## ðŸ“Š task learning
- Decision Trees & Random Forests
- Model evaluation using confusion matrix, accuracy, precision, recall
- Feature importance analysis
- Cross-validation for model reliability
